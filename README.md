## What this is

A practitioner ready case study that turns public data into a clear product strategy for an AI security offering. It shows how I frame markets, define value, and turn ideas into execution with owners and KPIs.

## Why this matters to Intellishore

It demonstrates the way I work with clients as a senior AI and ML consultant. From problem framing to a concrete plan with pilots, metrics, and governance that is ready for delivery in a cross functional team.

## How to review in three minutes

1. Open the PDF and read the one page summary.  
2. Skim the three most material initiatives and the roadmap.  
3. Note the first two pilots, required data, owners, and success measures.
