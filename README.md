A self contained case study that demonstrates how I structure a product strategy using only public data. It shows the way I frame markets, define value, and turn ideas into execution with clear ownership and KPIs.

Clients and hiring teams who want to see how I think and deliver.  
Consultants and product leaders who need a concise reference for AI security strategy.

2. Start with the one page summary.  
3. Skim the roadmap and the first pilots.  
4. Note decisions, owners, and metrics needed to start.

## What is inside

**Market and problem framing**  
Size, drivers, buyer pains, and where value concentrates.

## Why this is relevant

It is a live example of my approach to AI product strategy and enterprise adoption. It is built only from public sources to show how I work with limited inputs and create a plan that is actionable, testable, and measurable.
