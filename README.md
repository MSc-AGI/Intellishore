## What this is
A practitioner-ready case study that shows a product strategy for an AI-native developer-security offering from public availabel information. It shows how I frame markets, define value, and turn ideas into execution with owners and KPIs.

## Why this matters to YOU
It demonstrates how I partner with product, engineering, and go-to-market teams in a senior AI/ML product-management role. From problem framing to a concrete plan with pilots, metrics, and governance ready for delivery in a cross-functional environment.

## How to review in three minutes
1. Read the one-page summary of the concept and vision.
2. Review the three strategic initiatives and corresponding roadmap milestones.
3. Focus on the pilot designs, required data inputs, team ownership, and success metrics.

## What is inside
**Market and problem framing**  
**Product analysis**  
**Go to market and scale**  
**Twelve to twenty four month roadmap**  
**Execution playbook**

## Source and format
Built only from public information. Designed as a strategic product-management deliverable for developer-security and AI platforms.

**This work sample leverages my MSc in AI with an AGI focused thesis and product management experience at scale.**
